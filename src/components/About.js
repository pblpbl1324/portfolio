        <h2>Interest in Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>I believe that augmented reality glasses, like the Hololens 2, Google Glass, and Apple's smart glasses
            all have potential to become the next smartphone of future generations.</p>
        <p>I like coding video games and doing competitive programming on sites like <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/pblpbl">DMOJ</a> and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/pblpbl">Codeforces</a>.
