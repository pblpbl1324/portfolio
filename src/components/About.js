        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Bill Gan, a high school student from Milliken Mills HS. I would like to get into software engineering
            and computer engineering in the University of Waterloo.

        <h4>Interest in Software Engineering</h4>
        <p>I believe that augmented reality glasses, like the Hololens 2, Google Glass, Facebook's and Apple's smart glasses</p>
        <p>will become "the next smartphone of future generations". The possibilities for business, education, gaming, and medicine 
            can be truly groundbreaking.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I like coding video games and doing competitive programming on sites like <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/pblpbl">DMOJ</a> and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/pblpbl">Codeforces</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I would like to study software engineering, computer science, or computer engineering at the University of Waterloo</p>
        <p>to develop innovative software or hardware.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Programming languages</h4>
        <p>I am experienced in C++, Java, Python, and React JS.</p>
